# Airbnb_honest_host

## Project Summary
The Superhost program at Airbnb gives the host more visibility, earning potential, and exclusive rewards. It's obvious that a larger protion of revenue was generated by the professional hosts. However, the uniqueness of listings on the platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual hosts does not grow at the same rate. In this project, we are promoting a new way of identifying “Honest Host” whose reviews given by residents are matching with the host’s description, using text data mining, sentimental analysis, and clustering.

## Dataset
We obtained our dataset from Insideairbnb.com, where newly scraped data of listings in dozens of cities and countries around the world was updated quarterly for public uses.
